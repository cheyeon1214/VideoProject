A class which implements ITU-T (formerly CCITT) Recomendation G711
"Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) of Voice Frequencies"

This encodes and decodes uniform PCM values to/from 8 bit A-law and u-Law values.

Note, the methods in this class use uniform PCM values which are of 16 bits precision,
these are 'left justified' values corresponding to the 13 and 14 bit values described
in G711.
